Notes:

So We wanted to write a wrapper

The wrapper has the job of

Wrapper function
	function has parameter
?	How was the parameters picked?
?Pipeline Attributes
?	classification or Regresssion?
?	Number of classes?

How do you organize documenation for a class?

Is it an interface or an implementation
What is the general workflow?
How are we capturing that workflow
Not only workflow
but alos persistence of objects

Do we need to implement a data base?

We need to take into account

Building a pipeline | Saving a pipeline
                    | will not be altered 
                    | Might be used

___________________________
Need to do some imagining
The flow of work
When how to segment that?

What is the general state of the team?
We could organize ourselves like supreme court judges
Each person agrees to work on a project

The project has a goal to use the data to predict as output

People car abot the team performance but also on some level

People write pipeline, team of people write a pipeline, and even do certain parts.

People get experience with methods by implementing them as a pipeline
But how do we review how good of an idea the implementation
	How many projects use that method?
	how well did the tool do in prediction?
	relation to the best? post mordem?
	relative to our best?
	Take both hidden and shown results

If we write a script in R
What about it needs to be saved to our python(logs)

Can we automate submission?
	and get the result back?

Can I teach something to matt?

How do we automate kaggle submissions

Web application to controll synchronization?

I work on projects

Goal Track Our work with Machine Learning

takes the form
	testing new data with old scripts
	generate featurs
	manipulate features
	(Fit Parameters)
	make predictions
	make a new pipeline

Our goal is to form the best pipeline for the job

Top Note: Development mode, print now

Classes
	People
		Work on many problems
		Create parts for solution
	Problem
		Has many attempts at a solution called pipelines
	Pipelines
		Have many components
	Components
			Feature Generator
			Feature Set Modifier
			Prediction Algorithm
			Ensemble
				Has many Prediction Algorithms
		Produces one final prediction
Script: Pipeline: Working vs Finished

Pipeline-
	Does not depend on the problem
	Should only take a name(not even that if python reads the directory) then run its process and procedure and produce an output. 
	Has a unique name based on what it does detailed.

How do we create new pipeline?
	We will want to test different componenet viability?

Maybe have some test pipelines

The thing is that the final pipeline is only used once.
The Testing one need to be dynamical.

We need a generic pipeline that
Will then
	Have a work with method
	That takes an object and ____ that is the pipeline
	instead of the existing, it is a temperary pipeline that produces a report and can stay

We recommend that all exchanges be made into a new pipeline with that name

So what does the generic pipeline need?

What type of components and how many?

So it needs to store a lists of them.

Back to the dynamics thing.
	maybe not a __ with, but a 
		append....
		set as only.....

BTTDB

Get a new problem
	load data
	run a few things and see how they did (diagnostic tests)
Suggestions
Can we compare data?

How do we compre problems?
	That would be the first question
	These should be a series of diagnostic tests or predictions
	And see how it performs compared to other problem

Diagnostic tests

Could I make it into a graphical interface?

Maybe, but wouldnt it be too difficult

I dont know, who would use it?

People who have data? now it wouldnt be useful to them.

Would it?

Could you get people who dont do it?

now to do it?

into a fold it.

Its been done! That what we call it!

You can pass in a data set and get it computed.

What would happen?

I think it would undercut people in the field on one hand, on the other hand it would be a way for people to get into the fields.

Post Mordem
How did the selected submissions do?

how do you pick the submission?

We need to submit a lot of stuff?

This is where the automatic submission would work.

BTTDB
At this point it wouldd help to make ___

Our tool helps message prediction submission or kaggle for individual and teams.
	By suggesting a file structure to keep their data organized
		abstract away input and output in from compressed files
		Allows you to build operaiotns for all projects
		you to build operations for all projects
	by separating the road from data to prediction into stages in a pipeline
		Allowing you to build models by trying to combine components
		prescribing a template by whic to stage the development
	by tracking contributions
		That allow for personal analysis
		Facilitate compilation of reports of projects
		Help predict project similarities leading to learning suggestions.

One thing that I have largely forgotten is the tracking of contributions

How do we do that?
	What do they care about?
		The proficiency of using different methods
		Having contributed to projects different stages

	I think we build in a parameter to function calls so that that is used to link a name to a method.
		Which is abstracted to 
			projects
			pipelines
			stages

How do we pick parameters for function
	That can be hard
	People might want to track that too.

How to make the log make sense: Different sections
	Contributors,
	method name, 
	parameters, 
	stage, 
	project notes on method
	parameters, 
	project, 
	stage, 
	data

That should be it
Weighting in post mordem
Method usefullness weighted based on how will it did related to our best
most by stage
how will it did in pipeline on maybe and submission.

When to print?
	not all the time 
		we will have logs full of junk but everything and that is submitted be saved, nothing else.

from the saved state can we write code to recreate it?
directly take our own mockup.
	not really useful because we will have the pipeline saved

Here is a thought
	All submissios aved
	but labeld int
	the last one in the tree with the same name gets final.

Then we have to have a list of things to do 
When using another script
	Copy and change to final

Can it pull info about the due hard coding.
