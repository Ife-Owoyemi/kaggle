Contest Lifecycle
1) Sign up for new contest
2) Make directory with full contest name
3) Put inputs in the folder with the conventional names of "tain.csv" and "test.csv"
"train.csv" formatting rules(To Be Written)
"test.csv" formatting rules(To Be Written)
All Data files will be kept compressed and should be submitted like that.  unzip files in local repositories and DO NOT put them in the repository
4) Prediction Scripts belong in the folder of their respective languages
They should be appropriately named.  Need to think about a way to structure them within the file.
Some possible descriptions: complex scripts vs bare bones, provided scripts, separate between data manipulation methods and prediction methods.  Reviewing methods.
5) Have a post mortem system  
6) Analyze the results and see how others did it to perform better.
To Do
1) We need a naming conventions for ouputs from scripts and scripts.
I propose that we just do :name of script + "out.csv
Seems reasonable
2) We should be probably be responsible for our own environments
3) We shoul find a way to keep an analysis of the data and results of the outputs from test in the same file.  
4) A way to queue submissions would be nice.
5) Some automatic testing would be cool.
6) Having a file track what it uses, like methods and parameters to put into the submission text.
